# TrustBasedEncounter

Several routing protocols in MANET have been proposed which emphasize on optimal route discovery without considering security. Several trust metrics have been proposed for trust calculation such as packet forwarding rate, receiving rate, packet missrouted and so on. However, they only show
their efficiency in static scenarios. To deal with the mobility factor, an attempt has been made to find a suitable trust metric besides the existing trust metrics. It introduces average encounter rate as one of the trust metric based on the concept of Encounter. It proposed a trust based routing
protocol which evaluates direct trust with Confrontation Rate(CF) and Cooperative Behavior Frequency(CBF). Indirect trust is evaluated using the revised D-S evidence theory. Simulation results show that this method can isolate the malicious nodes effectively when building the route. In addition, it achieves better performance than AODV in terms of throughput and packet delivery ratio.
It has been done in NS2 Simulator using TCL script
